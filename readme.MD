# Patriots Python Examples

This repository contains Python code examples with a New England Patriots theme. These examples cover various concepts in Python programming, as defined in Harvard's Python cs50
as taught by david malan, who trends towards harry potter examples, but looking at them with
patriots examples instead. We follow the python refresher flow of providing examples of functions, variables, conditionals, loops, exceptions, libraries, tests, file i/o, regular expressions and object oriented programming. additionally there are some datasets we used for our use cases from the world champion 2004 Patriots. 

## Usage

Each Python file in this repository can be executed to see the demonstration of the respective concept. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

To run a Python file, open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and run the command:

```bash
python3 filename.py

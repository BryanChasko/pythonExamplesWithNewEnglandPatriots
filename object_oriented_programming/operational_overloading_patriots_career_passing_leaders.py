Understanding Operational Overloading and Special Method Names in Python  üêç
üèà Utilizing career passing leaders for the New England Patriots, this script demonstrates the concept of operational
overloading and special method names in Python. It defines a Quarterback class to represent football quarterback
statistics and uses special method names to provide custom behavior for built-in operators such as +, -, *, /, etc.

Concepts Covered:
- Operational overloading: The ability to define custom behavior for built-in operators such as +, -, *, /, etc. for
user-defined classes.
- Special method names: Methods in Python that have double underscores before and after their names, e.g., __init__,
__str__, __add__, etc. These methods are also known as "magic methods" or "dunder methods" and provide functionality
to emulate built-in behavior within user-defined classes.

What to Look for in the File:
1. Class Definition: The definition of the Quarterback class, which represents football quarterback statistics.
2. Initialization Method (__init__): Explanation of how instance variables are initialized using the __init__ method.
3. String Representation Method (__str__): Implementation of the __str__ method to provide a string representation of
Quarterback objects.
4. Addition Method (__add__): Explanation of how the __add__ method overloads the addition operator (+) to combine
statistics of Quarterback objects.
5. Object Creation: Creation of Quarterback objects with relevant statistics for New England Patriots quarterbacks.
6. Total Statistics: Calculation of total statistics by adding the statistics of all quarterbacks using the overloaded
addition operator.
7. Logging and Color Highlighting: Usage of logging module to display quarterback statistics with color highlighting for
better readability.

By studying this file, you will gain a clear understanding of how operational overloading and special method names work
in Python, along with practical examples demonstrating their usage in a real-world scenario.
